# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
this project is going to develop a customer behavior analysis model based on RFM model and Logistic Regression algorithm <br>
____
# Executive Summary
Under the age of digital transformation and COVID, people are willing to surf internet to purchase items for their interests and daily life. To stand from the knee competition in e-Commerce market, especially retail industry, companies desire a tool to study and visualize their customer behavior in order to develop a high-degree of customization marketing campiagn or product to customer.<br>
Data is the best tool to represent, measure, and record the customer activities which happened in the store. OpenData Bank (The Bank) is the 2021 opendata project which is launched by HKTV. The Bank provides a busienss data of HKTV mall to public which includes Transaction and Traffic Data. It is a great opportunity for the public to study the customer in Hong Kong. Most of the companies would like to identify the most profitable customers and invest resources with them for customer relationship management. Therefore, "Who are our valuable customers?" is the common busienss problem in the question list of company. <br>
This project is going to develop a RFM model to define the meaning of "profitable" with clustering algoritm and :<br>
1. detect the most profitable customers using RFM model
2. study profitable customers consumption behavior after detection through regression model with features selection
## Findings Conclusion
From this data project, we found the valuable customers have the following behavior preferences:
1. creating orders through mobile application instead of web version of HKTV mall
2. personal care & health, housewares and mother & baby are the top hit product categories
3. making orders on Wednesday

## Data Source
The source of data is from [OpenData Bank](https://opendatabank.hktvmall.com/portal/home) which contains 2021Q1 transaction data. Those daily raw data are stored as csv file with gzip compression. Therefore, we concatenate 90 raw data files in 2021Q1 to two dataset with selected columns and rough data filter for RFM modeling and logistic regression model. 

```python 
import pandas as pd
import os
raw_data_dir = "<the raw data directory>"

def rough_data_cleansing(file_path:str):
  df = pd.read_csv(file_path, compression="gzip")
  df.dropna("area") # since the data project includes the geometric data for analysis, we have to filter out the na value from the raw data
  return df[<selected column>]
  
full_dataset = pd.DataFrame("<map data_cleansing function to take raw data with rough cleaning from raw_data_dir>")
RFM_raw = full_dataset[["hktv_ad_id", "order_number", "order_value", "order_date"]]
behavior_raw = full_dataset["<list of columns: please refer the file of keep_columns.csv>"]
```

## Data Cleansing
the data cleansing stage would have 2 parts :
1. RFM model : _the RFM raw would be converted to Recency [the difference between observation date(1 April, 2021) and last_order_date], Frequency[the customer purchase frequency in 2021Q1] and Monatoary[total order value generated by customers in 2021Q1]_
2. behavior data aggregation : _the raw transaction data is the sku-level data. sku-level data means the dataset record are based on sku items as one row. For the analysis, the project needs a membership-level data which contains the customer information and consumption behavior summary in the period of 2021Q1. Thus the aggregation would be performed two times to convert the raw data from sku-level to order-level then the final membership-level._

```python 
import pandas as pd
# for the behavior data
order_level_data = order_level_aggregation(behavior_raw)
membership_level_data = membership_level_aggregation(order_level_data)

# for RFM data
cluster_result = RFM_cluster(RFM_raw)

final_dataset = cluster_result.merge(membership_level_data, on='hktv_ad_id')
```

## Data Analysis
### cluster result
![cluster result](output.png "cluster result")
### features information
Before feature selection : 407 columns includes dummies variables
After feature selection with Lasso Regression:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

dataset = StandardScaler(final_dataset)
lr = LogisticRegression(random_state = 0, penalty="l1", solver = "liblinear")
best_lr = RFE(estimator, n_features_to_select=10, step=0.05).fit(dataset, cluster_result)
model = lr.fit(dataset[:,best.support_], cluster_result)
```
|features|coefficients|
|-----------------------|------------------|
|prim_cat_variety|-2.874463|
|sub_cat_4_variety|0.310319|
|primary_category_name_en_Mother & Baby|0.359407|
|total_package_weight|0.366072|

|sales_application_Web|2.827818|
|sales_application_WebMobile|3.585540|

## Business Implications
1. Sales_application_WebMobile has the biggest coefficient (3.588540) and the sales_application_Web has the second largest coefficient (2.827818).It indicates that online customers prefer to use handful application (e.g. Mobile Phone) to make order, comparing to web version of HKTV mall (3. 588540>2. 827818)<br>
2. HKTV Mall’s consumers tend to purchase goods with promotion and might have continuous shopping habits to enjoy promotion. Items under promotion (0.663664) is positively correlated with profitable customers. It indicated that the if there have a discount on the original price of a good, more customers will make purchase on the discount goods.
3.	Personal Care & Health (0.614956), Housewares(0.533115) and Mother& Baby (0.359407) are the only positive correlation with consumers in the “Primary Category and Sub_Cat_1” column. When these’ categories’ goods are available for purchase on the HKTV Mall, the customers with high RFM score would like to make an order, prioritizing with Personal Care & Health, Housewares and Mother& Baby’s products.
4.	Wednesday (0.454174) is the peak day among other order dates. When it is Wednesdays, more high RFM score customers would like to make order(s).
