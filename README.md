# Executive Summary
Under the age of digital transformation and COVID, people are willing to surf internet to purchase items for their interests and daily life. To stand from the knee competition in e-Commerce market, especially retail industry, companies desire a tool to study and visualize their customer behavior in order to develop a high-degree of customization marketing campiagn or product to customer.<br>
Data is the best tool to represent, measure, and record the customer activities which happended in the store.OpenData Bank (The Bank) is the 2021 opendata project which is launched by HKTV. The Bank provides a busienss data of HKTV mall to public which includes Transaction and Traffic Data. It is a greate opportunity to public to study the customer in Hong Kong. Most of the companies would like to identify the most profitable customers and invest resources with them for customer relationship management. Therefore, "Who are our valuable customers?" is the common busienss problem in the question list of company. <br>
This project is going to develop a RFM model to define the meaning of "profitable" with clustering algoritm and :<br>
1. detect the most profitable customers using RFM model
2. study profitable customers consumption behavior after detection through regression model with features selection
<br>
From this data project, we found the valuable customers have the following behavior preferences:
1.  pretend to create or through mobile application instead of web version of HKTV mall
2.  personal care & health, housewares, fruits, vegetables & flowers, and mother & baby are the top hit product categories
3.  pretend to make order on wedesday and satuarday
4.  unfavor to weighted packages
5.  concetrate to purchase a specific primary categories


# Research Method
At the first stage of project (the profitable customers detection) is based on the well-known customer segmentation model - RFM Model to identify the valuable customer for HKTV Mall. Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is a model used in marketing analysis that segments a company's consumer base by their purchasing patterns or habits. In particular, it evaluates customers' recency (how long ago they made a purchase), frequency (how often they make purchases), and monetary value (how much money they spend).RFM is then used to identify a company's or an organization's best customers by measuring and analyzing spending habits in order to improve low-scoring customers and maintain high-scoring ones.The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:
1. ___Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase.___
2. ___Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase.___
3. ___Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends on purchases.___<br>
RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The "best" customer would receive a top score in every category.

These three RFM factors can be used to reasonably predict how likely (or unlikely) it is that a customer will do business again with a firm or, in the case of a charitable organization, make another donation.
